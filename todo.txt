Still need to:

Implement basic behavior for Text Unit widget
    (probably find a basic open-source WYSIWYG editor rather than rolling my own thing based on contenteditable)
Dynamically create Text Unit widgets
Saving and loading:
    to/from Web Storage
    to/from JSON
    export to more usable text
