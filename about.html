        <h1>Pretty Good</h1>
        <p>Pretty Good is a tool for writers to organize and visualize their writing.</p>
        <h2>Recommended usage</h2>
        <p>When you begin a new writing project, think of your unwritten text as being in many discrete sections. Start by replacing my title and author's name with yours. Then, start writing in the blank new section automatically created.</p>
        <p>In the left-hand column, place notes about what you hope to accomplish in that section. The larger column on the right will contain your draft. More controls are visible at the top: you can color-code your section according to the draft's progress (recommended usage: white means Blank, gray means Unfinished, red means Bad, yellow means Pretty Good, green means Finished), add new sections, and delete or rearrange sections.</p>
        <p>Pretty Good will automatically save your progress on your computer, using the Local Storage API of modern browsers. This is completely secure: no data is sent to the server it is hosted upon. However, it is both possible and encouraged to download its source code and use a local copy of Pretty Good, or host a version on your own server.</p>
        <p>To manage your data manually, simply use the "Backup" button to receive a file containing the current data, and the "Restore" button to load the data from any such file, replacing the current data. Once you're finished, the "Export" button will produce a plain text file which you can then markup in a richer editor of your choosing.</p>
        <p>The author P. G. Wodehouse was said to have hung each page of an unfinished manuscript on the wall, with their relative heights indicating his perception of their quality, and only when they were all uniformly high did he consider the story fit for publication. This inspired the digital process that Pretty Good uses to visualize the completeness of each logical unit of text.</p>
        <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
        <p>Despite its title, Pretty Good is, by the standards of its own author, neither pretty nor good, at least for the time being. Many essential features, including keyboard shortcuts and attractive, modern visuals, have yet to be implemented. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
